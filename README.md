# Movie-Data-Exploration-Analysis
In-depth data analysis and visualization of movie attributes using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and a Jupyter Notebook.
üé¨ TMDB Movie Data Analysis & Visualization

Project Overview

This repository contains an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a comprehensive movie dataset. The primary goal is to uncover trends, correlations, and insights related to movie performance, popularity, language, and genre distribution using Python's powerful data science ecosystem.

The core analysis is performed within a Jupyter Notebook, making the process and findings easy to follow and reproduce.

üìä Key Analysis Areas

The analysis focuses on exploring questions such as:

Distribution of movie releases over time.

Correlation between Vote Average and Popularity.

Analysis of the most common and highest-rated Genres.

Insights into the performance metrics of different Original Languages.

Identification of potential outliers or unique characteristics in the dataset.

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Getting Started

To run this analysis locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites

You need Python 3 and pip installed.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME]


Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


Install the necessary Python libraries:
Since you are using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, you should install them.

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter

Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Analysis.ipynb


The notebook will open in your browser, allowing you to execute the cells and see the full analysis workflow and results.
